		<img src="./images/vk7.jpg" height="250" width="250" align="right">
		<p>In the video, a young Kohli is shown training at home and batting in the nets. He works hard with a burning dream to play for India. It soon cuts to him wearing an India jersey and fans cheering for his achievements and the name he has made for himself.

        Kohli's special achievements can also be heard in the voice over; the fastest player to score 6000 One-Day International (ODI) runs, being named the ICC Cricketer of the Year (2011-12), being honoured with the Arjuna award in 2013, scoring the fastest ODI century by an Indian in just 52 balls against Australia in 2013 in Jaipur and finally being named India captain.
        The most important man in Indian cricket – there is possibly no other, or more apt, way to describe Virat Kohli.

	<p>Be it scoring centuries, breaking records, chasing targets, or leading the team to new heights – there is very little that Kohli hasn't achieved.


     And he’s only just turned 29. Today.To celebrate the man who gives India a reason to rejoice so very often, The Quint has put together this compilation on the Virat we all know, and a little of the Virat that we don't.


      What were his dreams before he first made headlines? Who does he credit his cricketing career to? What’s he like, when he's around friends and family? How much time does he devote to cricket when he's off the field? How much does he love his fans? Twenty-nine years of this legend in the making.</p>

	<p> virat kohli's rise from a humble background to a cricketing superstar has not been less than an inspiration. from the struggling days when he lost his fatherto making a mark in the national cricket team and later becoming the captain, is no mean feat. the 28-year-old has become the heart-throb of the entire nation, is adored by his fans while oppositions fear him. he recently led india to wins against england in all three formats of the game and also featured as the wisden cricketers' almanack cover star for scoring 2595 runs in 2016.
 While Kohli's life story has been shared time and again at different forums, it, however, has not been documented as compared to other cricketing heroes.

To let people know of his hardships and journey, he shared a video on social media which shows his story. The video starts with the Delhi-born travelling in a team bus, walking down the memory lane. He remembers the day he drove to the stadium for a match even after being told of his father's death.</p>
